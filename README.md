# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset containing customer information such as age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## Features

- **EDA**: Data Distribution, Variables Correlation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of features to prepare data for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
- **Elbow Method**: Determination of the optimal number of clusters.
- **3D Visualization**: 3D scatter plots to visualize customer segments.
- **Evaluation**: Use of Silhouette Score to assess clustering quality.
